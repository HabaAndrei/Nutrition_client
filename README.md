# Project Overview

## Technologies Used:
- React
- Tailwind
- Firebase
- Docker
- Nginx

### React
The React part of the project is well-developed and thoroughly checked to catch all errors, allowing me to display them to the client in the console. I have not overused the 'useEffect' or 'useState' components.

### Account Creation
The account creation process is fully secured as I only allow users to create accounts using their Google accounts. This way, I rely on Google's security measures.

### Docker
I chose to use Docker because I wanted a scalable project that allows real-time server editing. Therefore, I deployed the project to Google Cloud using Kubernetes (k8s).

### NGINX
I use NGINX to handle request routing and provide the fastest possible response in my project.
